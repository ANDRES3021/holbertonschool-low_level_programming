### 0-preprocessor: 

Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE -The output should be saved in the file c

###  1-compiler: 
Script that compiles a C file but does not link. - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o

### 2-assembler: 
Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
### 3-name:
Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
### 4-puts.c: 
C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. - Use the function puts - Your program should end with the value 0
### 5-printf.c: 
C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.- Your program should return 0 - Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option
### 6-size.c :
C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. - Warnings are allowed - Your program should return 0 - You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux (Vagrant) to test the -m32 gcc option
### Write a blog post that explains all the steps of compilation.
Use command lines and examples to illustrate.
Use gcc as the compiler
Have at least one picture, at the top of the blog post
Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn
Share your blog post at least on LinkedIn
Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings

### 100-intel: 
Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
